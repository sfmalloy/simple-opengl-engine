/// \brief A 4x4 matrix of floats with the requirement that the bottom row
///   must be 0, 0, 0, 1.  This type of matrix can be used to represent any

/// The matrix is interpreted thus:
///   [ rx ux bx px ]
///   [ ry uy by py ]
///   [ rz uz bz pz ]
///   [  0  0  0  1 ] 
/// 'r', 'u', 'b', and 'p' are the right, up, back,

/// The last row is not explicitly stored since it is always
